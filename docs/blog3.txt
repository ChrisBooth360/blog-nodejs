# My Personal Library

This application acts like a virtual bookshelf where a user can add specific versions of their books to their bookshelf and categorize them in various ways.

## Project Goals and Scope

### Goals

This project has two primary goals:

1. Keeping track of my physical library by creating a catalog of the specific versions of every book on my bookshelf.
2. Improving my knowledge and experience with the MERN tech stack

### Scope

This web application will have the following features and functionalities:

* User sign up and sign in. (Despite the inception of this project being about my own personal library, I want to teach myself sign-in/signup functionality - including authorization and authentication).
* Search functionality. Users will be able to search a database for specific versions of their books - this can be achieved by using an API and specific ISBN numbers.
* Users will be able to view all the details about their books, including, but not limited to:
    * Title
    * Author
    * Blurb
    * Date of Publication
    * Current version publication
    * Number of Pages
    * Cover Image

* Users will be able to store their chosen book in the database.
* Users will be able to mark books as unread, read, or currently reading.

What falls outside of the project's scope for the moment:
* Other users or visitors to the site will not be able to view others' books.
* Users won't yet be able to categorise the books in their library.
* Users won't yet be able to show their progress with their 'currently reading' books.
* Users will not be able to rate and review the books on their shelves.
* Users will not have the option for 'want to read books' - as this web application is only for the store of books already on a user's bookshelf.

## User Stories and Use Cases:

* **As a visitor**, I want to see the homepage and see what the application is about.
* **As a pre-registered user**, I want to be able to sign up to be able to create my own virtual bookshelf.
* **As a registered user**, I want to be able to log in to my account with my email and password so that I can access my personal library.
* **As a registered user**, I want to search for books by title, author, or ISBN number so that I can find and add specific books to my library.
* **As a registered user**, I want to add a book to my library and categorize it as "unread," "read," or "currently reading."
* **As a registered user**, I want to view details of the books added to my bookshelf.
* **As a registered user**, I want to log out of my account to ensure the security of my personal library.

### Use Case 1: Browsing the Homepage as a Visitor

**Actors:** Visitor

**Description:**

1. The visitor arrives at the homepage of the personal library application.
2. On the homepage, the visitor can read more about the application.

### Use Case 2: Registering as a New User

**Actors:** Visitor

**Description:**

1. The visitor arrives at the homepage of the personal library application.
2. The visitor sees a "Sign Up" or "Register" button in the application's navigation menu.
3. The visitor clicks on the "Sign Up" or "Register" button.
4. The system displays a registration form that prompts the visitor to enter the following information:
    * Full Name
    * Email Address
    * Password
    * Confirm Password
5. The visitor enters their details into the registration form.
6. The system validates the information, checking for proper email format and password matching.
7. If the validation is successful, the visitor is registered as a new user, and an account is created.
8. The system redirects the newly registered user to their dashboard or a welcome page.
9. The visitor is now a registered user and can access the full functionality of the application, including features like searching for books, and adding books to their library.

### Use Case 3: Searching and Adding a Book to the Library

**Actors:** Registered User

**Description:**

1. The registered user logs in to the application.
2. The user searches for a specific book using the search functionality.
3. The search results are displayed, and the user selects the desired book from the results.
4. On the book's details page, the user clicks an "Add to Library" button.
5. The user is prompted to categorize the book as "unread," "read," or "currently reading."
6. The book is added to the user's personal library with the chosen status.

### Use Case 4: Viewing Books in Library

**Actors:** Registered User

**Description:**
1. The registered user logs in to the application.
2. The user sees a dashboard that lists all the books in their library.
3. The user can organise their library by title, author, category, etc.
    * The default sorting is "currently reading" at the top, "unread" second and "read" third. Each category is presented alphabetically by author by default.

## TODO: Write Learning Journey

I am at the stage in my coding journey where I don't want to do any more beginner 'cookie-cutter' projects. I want to do something that sparks my passion and stands out a little from the generic calculators and weather apps. 

The trouble is that most tutorials online are either for abolute beginners, or they are paint-by-number projects that I'm not interested in. The second problem is that if I don't use tutorials for my own projects, how will I learn to create something at this intermediate stage? This is where my true self-taught learning journey begins. 

Here I will share how I came up with my project idea, how I went about creating it, and the things I learnt along the way.

## The Conception of My Library

I love to read. But I love one thing more: to collect books. While I don't mind reading a good ebook, there is nothing better than holding a physical book and turning real pages. I also enjoy using an app like GoodReads - I can add books I want to read to my profile, set myself reading goals, and even show off my reading progress. (There's nothing better than the endorphine hit you get when you mark a book complete on GoodReads.) This lead me to toy with the idea of creating a GoodReads clone. But at the same time, I didn't want to build an *exact* clone. I wanted something a little more personal.

This is where my physical TBR (to be read) comes in. While moving house to a smaller place, I realised that I would have to put some of my books into storage - or lend them out. The problem is that, while on GoodReads I have a whole bunch of 'read' and 'want to read' books that I do not own, I didn't have anything to catelogue and keep track of the physical books I actually have. I also wanted to add to my shelves the *exact* version of the book I owned (something that I didn't know was possible with GoodReads until after this whole process).

But with these two things in mind, I decided to create my own application that would act as a catelogue for all my owned books. This is where the idea for My Library was born.
